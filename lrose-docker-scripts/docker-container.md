# The Lrose-Blaze Docker image

## What is it?

Lrose-Blaze allows you to run Lrose applications without having to
compile and install lrose binaries and libraries. 

It is a Ubuntu 14.04 image, with lrose-core installed in 
/usr/local/lrose.

It has one user named **lrose** so if you don't want to run commands
as root, you can specify **-u lrose** when you `docker run` or `docker exec`

## Installing and running

### Getting the lrose-blaze image

* From hub.docker.com (the default repository for the docker command)

   `docker pull nsflrose/lrose-blaze`
   
   This should pull the **latest** tag.

* If you want to test a different image. For example ifyou have access to a tar file of the image

   `docker import lroze-blaze.tgz`

Verify it is there with `docker images`

```
$ docker images
REPOSITORY                   TAG                 IMAGE ID     
nsflrose/lrose-blaze         04132018            0a2ce9c9ae0f 
ubuntu_apache2               latest              4b5eefbe9c6c 
ncareol/soloii               latest              baa1ee4c3541
```
Chances are that instead of a name and tag, you will see **none**.
Since the **lrose** wrapper assumes an image name of *lrose-blaze* you want to tag the image. Use the `docker tag` command to do that. (Replace **0a2ce9c9ae0f** with the image ID `docker images` shows you)

```
docker tag lrose-blaze:04112018 0a2ce9c9ae0f
```
	
### Using the lrose wrapper ###

The `lrose` wrapper is a bash script that tries to make running and
managing docker containers a bit easier. Instead of having to provide
a lot of docker arguments (image name, container name, display
variable, volume mounts...) an lrose command invocation is reduced to
something like this: 

```
lrose <few_options> -- <command> <options>
```

You can run `lrose -h` to see what options the wrapper supports.

For example, to run `HawkEye` in archive mode.

```
lrose -- HawkEye -archive_url /tmp/KHGX -start_time "2017 08 00 00 00" -time_span 7200
```

The `lrose` wrapper reads in ~/.lroseargs which allows you to specify additional options to the `docker run` command. 
It supports volume, environment, and raw arguments. Add any combination, one option per line.

  * Comments start with **#**
  * /from:to is passed as **-v /from:/to**
  * var=value is passed as **-e var=value**
  * --anything is pased unchanged **--anything**
  
For the example above, you'd
add an entry to map your data directory to /tmp/KHGX in the container.

You can also add entries for other folders you might need in the
container. For example:

```
# Location of HawkEye input radar files
/path/to/some/folder/KHGX:/tmp/KHGX
# Output directory for lrose commands. Make sure I have write access
/my/path/to/large/disk:/tmp/output:rw
```

The `lrose` wrapper will convert all of these to `--volume` options
when running a container.

By default, your $HOME is mapped to $HOME (either /home/user on Linux, or /Users/user on a mac)

#### A few gotchas with volume mounting ###

  * Docker will try to mount volumes exactly as requested. The following will fail because you are trying to replace /tmp, not mount /somedir under /tmp: `-v /somedir:/tmp`. If you want to mount a directory somewhere, you have to specify an absolute path. For example `/somedir:/tmp/somedir`.
  * */tmp*, */*, and probably other crucial directories can't be overwritten. So this won't work: `-v /:/` (trying to replace / inside the container)
  * NFS mounted volumes need a bit more work. See the **Mapping NFS Volumes** section below
  
#### A few gotchas with the lrose wrapper ####

  * The lrose wrapper is meant do run commands in **batch** bode. It doesn't handle the I/O required for interactive mode.
  So if you were to do something like this: `./lrose -- /bin/bash`, the container would be started and run /bin/bash, but you would never get a shell prompt, and any command you enter would not be passed on. You would have to stop and remove the container before being able to run the lrose wrapper again.
  
### Dealing with graphic accelerators ###

This is only needed for X11 graphic programs such as HawkEye, if you care about hardware acceleration. If the performance is good enough you can skip this section.

You might get this error message when running *HawkEye*:
*libGL error: failed to open drm device: No such file or directory* 

Follow [this guide](http://wiki.ros.org/docker/Tutorials/Hardware%20Acceleration) if you want to use graphic acceleration 

If your machine is using Intel graphics, adding the following to your **~/.lroseargs** would do the trick.

```
--device=/dev/dri:/dev/dri:rw
```

### Starting an lrose-blaze container

If you decide to manage your containers yourself instead of using the `lrose` wrapper, you have a few scenarios to choose from:

1. One time command run

	```
	docker run --rm -it ... lrose-blaze \
	           /usr/local/lrose/bin/RadxCheck ...
	```
	
2. Keep the container running and execute multiple commands

  First, start the contanier in *detached* mode (the -d option).
  Give the container a name (the -n option) so that it is easier to
  reference than the container id you get from `docker ps`

   `docker run -d ... lrose-blaze -n my_container`
   
  Then you can *exec* commands in this container.
   
   ```
   docker exec -it my_container ... \
               /usr/local/lrose/bin/RadxCheck ...
   ```
   
   
3. Get an interactive shell in the container and run multiple commands from inside the container

   `docker run -it ... /bin/bash`
   
#### Mapping volumes (directories, folders)

You want to give commands in the container access to your data files. You do that by mapping **volumes** when starting your container with the run command.

The general format for the volume option is

   `-v machine_folder:container_folder`
   
You can have multiple **-v** options if you want access to multiple folders.

So for example if your data resides in **$HOME/mydata**, and you want to run run lrose commands that will write the output files to 
**$HOME/myoutput**, you could use the following options

   `-v $HOME/mydata:/data -v $HOME/myoutput:output`
   
Note that you need to use **absolute paths**. So in this example, there will be **/mydata** and **/myoutput** directories accessible from inside your container. 

If the options you give the command running inside the container direct it to find data from **/data** and to write output to **/output**, you should see the output in **$HOME/mydata** from outside the container once the command is done.

Also note that volume mapping must be done at the time you **run** a container. You can't add volume mapping when you **exec** a command on a running container.

#### Mapping NFS Volumes

Before you can map an NFS volume, you need to create it with the `docker volume create` command.
First, find out how it is mounted on your machine with the mount command.

`mount`

You'll probably see a line like the following:

`server:/path/to/volume on /path/to/mount-point type nfs4 (rw,.... )`

Look up the server IP address, and use is, as well as the path on the server (the /path/to/volume part, not the /path/to/mount-point), in your docker volume creation. I use **my_scratch** as the volume name, but you can obviously pick any name you like.

```
docker volume create --driver local --opt type=nfs \
   --opt o=addr=192.168.0.10,rw \
   --opt device=:/path/to/volume \
   my_scratch
```

That volume is then available to the -v option as explained in the section above (either on the lrose command line, or in your ~/.lroseargs file)

`-v my_scratch:lrose_output`

You can check what docker volumes have already been created with

`docker volume ls`

#### Running X11 programs (such as HawkEye)

Mac OS and Linux require sligtly different invocations to be able to display on your host machine.

##### Mac OS

Find the ip address of your machine, for example if your machine is called *my_machine* use this command: `host my_machine`

Let's say your address is 192.168.0.10 you can then invoke the docker run command with the following option: `-e DISPLAY=192.168.0.10`

To run *HawkEye*, you can start the container this way: (you will of course have to add a couple of -v mappings for the input and output folders)

```
docker run --name lrose_container --user lrose \
           -e DISPLAY=192.168.0.10:0  -v /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix:rw -it \
           -w /home/lrose lrose-blaze /usr/local/lrose/bin/HawkEye
```

##### Linux

You just have to use the `--env="DISPLAY" option to the docker run command.
You might have to set QT_X11_MITSHM to 1. MIT-SHM is an extension that allows faster transaction by using shared memory. This is blocked by docker isolation, so if the flag is not set you will get permission errors.

To run *HawkEye*, you can start the container this way: (you will of course have to add a couple of -v mappings for the input and output folders)

```
docker run --name lrose_container --user lrose \
           --env="DISPLAY" --env QT_X11_NO_MITSHM=1 \
           -v /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix:rw \
           -w /home/lrose lrose-blaze /usr/local/lrose/bin/HawkEye
```

#### Other useful options

* The *-e* option lets you set variables inside the container. For example, if you wanted to set DEBUG to 1, and EDITOR to emacs inside the container, you would use these 2 options on the *run* or *exec* command:

` ..... -e DEBUG=1 -e EDITOR=emacs .....`

## Some useful commands to manage containers and images

### List images available on your machine

`docker images`

This will list all images available to run, including their name and unique id.

### Stopping an lrose-blaze container

* If you were in an interactive shell, just `exit` That should get you out and stop the container

* If you want to stop a running container from outside of it

`docker stop ...`

Where ... is either the container name, or its unique id.

### List running containers

`docker ps`

This will list all running containers. You can use this command to get a container unique id.

### List non-running containers

`docker ps -a`

This will show when a container exited. 

Unless you provided the `-rm` option to the ***run*** command, a container that exited is still available on your machine. You could restart it with the `docker restart` command.

If you make any change inside the container, for example install more packages, add users, ..., these changes will persist if you restart the container. But once you remove it, all is lost.

### Permanently saving changes made to a container

You can preserve changes you have made by *comitting* a container to a new image. This can be very useful to customize your environment.

**Note** It is much safer to commit a non-running container. So stop the container first `docker stop ...` first, before using `docker commit ...`

This is outside the scope of this document, but you could for example install additional packages (ubuntu is debian based, so use the apt-get install command to do so).
You could add users, and customize their startup files (.bashrc, .chsrc, ...) to add aliases for commands...

Once the container is comitted, you can then start a new containers from that new image.



### Removing old containers

`docker rm ...`

Where ... is either a container name, or its unique id.

### Removing an image

`docker rmi ...`

Here again, ... is either the image name, or its unique id.
